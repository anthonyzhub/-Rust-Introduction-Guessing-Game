## H2 How I discovered Rust (programming language)

I discovered Rust programming language from my curiousity in concurrency. Concurrency allow programs to run multiple tasks at the same time. Imagine yourself cooking for a large family and you have all the ingredients, including a kitchen stove. The stove has 4 burners and you must make a big breakfast. Now, would you use the entire stove to make a few pancakes? Right now, only 1 burner is being used to cook the pancakes, while the other 3 remains idle. Wouldn't it be great, if you could use the other 3 burners for eggs, oatmeal, or whatever you may like? Of course you would! This is called concurrency and you are probably using a program right now with a focus a concurrency. How many tabs do you have open now? Which tabs are providing background noise?

Rust is similar to C++, but focuses on safe concurrency programming. It was released to the public in 2010 and available for download [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust). Once this language caught my interest, I immediately read its [official documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and followed its *Guessing Game* example. 

*Guessing Game* teaches me the basics and syntax of Rust in a creative manner. To prove my understanding of Rust, I wrote a comment on each line of code by describing its purpose and affect in the program.
